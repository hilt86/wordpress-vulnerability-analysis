1	CVE-2019-9787	352		Exec Code XSS CSRF	2019-03-14	2019-03-31	6.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	WordPress before 5.1.1 does not properly filter comment content, leading to Remote Code Execution by unauthenticated users in a default configuration. This occurs because CSRF protection is mishandled, and because Search Engine Optimization of A elements is performed incorrectly, leading to XSS. The XSS results in administrative access, which allows arbitrary changes to .php files. This is related to wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php and wp-includes/comment.php.
2	CVE-2019-8943	22		Dir. Trav.	2019-02-19	2019-04-25	4.0	None	Remote	Low	Single system	None	Partial	None	WordPress through 5.0.3 allows Path Traversal in wp_crop_image(). An attacker (who has privileges to crop an image) can write the output image to an arbitrary directory via a filename containing two image extensions and ../ sequences, such as a filename ending with the .jpg?/../../file.jpg substring.

The search engine could then index and display a user's e-mail address and (rarely) the password that was generated by default.
8	CVE-2018-20150	79		XSS	2018-12-14	2019-01-04	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	Partial	None	In WordPress before 4.9.9 and 5.x before 5.0.1, crafted URLs could trigger XSS for certain use cases involving plugins.
9	CVE-2018-20149	79		XSS Bypass	2018-12-14	2019-01-04	3.5	None	Remote	Medium	Single system	None	Partial	None	In WordPress before 4.9.9 and 5.x before 5.0.1, when the Apache HTTP Server is used, authors could upload crafted files that bypass intended MIME type restrictions, leading to XSS, as demonstrated by a .jpg file without JPEG data.
10	CVE-2018-20148	502			2018-12-14	2019-01-04	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In WordPress before 4.9.9 and 5.x before 5.0.1, contributors could conduct PHP object injection attacks via crafted metadata in a wp.getMediaItem XMLRPC call. This is caused by mishandling of serialized data at phar:// URLs in the wp_get_attachment_thumb_file function in wp-includes/post.php.

12	CVE-2018-14028	434		Exec Code	2018-08-10	2018-10-10	6.5	None	Remote	Low	Single system	Partial	Partial	Partial	In WordPress 4.9.7, plugins uploaded via the admin area are not verified as being ZIP files. This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine's wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.
13	CVE-2018-12895	22		Exec Code Dir. Trav.	2018-06-26	2018-08-20	6.5	None	Remote	Low	Single system	Partial	Partial	Partial	WordPress through 4.9.6 allows Author users to execute arbitrary code by leveraging directory traversal in the wp-admin/post.php thumb parameter, which is passed to the PHP unlink function and can delete the wp-config.php file. This is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase the attacker's privileges.
14	CVE-2018-10102	79		XSS	2018-04-16	2018-05-18	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	Partial	None	Before WordPress 4.9.5, the version string was not escaped in the get_the_generator function, and could lead to XSS in a generator tag.

39	CVE-2017-8295	640			2017-05-04	2017-11-03	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	Partial	None	WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-reset e-mail message, which makes it easier for remote attackers to reset arbitrary passwords by making a crafted wp-login.php?action=lostpassword request and then arranging for this message to bounce or be resent, leading to transmission of the reset key to a mailbox on an attacker-controlled SMTP server. This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing the original message.

252	CVE-2007-0262			+Info	2007-01-16	2018-10-16	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	None	None	WordPress 2.0.6, and 2.1Alpha 3 (SVN:4662), does not properly verify that the m parameter value has the string data type, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an invalid m[] parameter, as demonstrated by obtaining the path, and obtaining certain SQL information such as the table prefix.
253	CVE-2007-0233			Exec Code	2007-01-12	2017-10-18	7.5	User	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	wp-trackback.php in WordPress 2.0.6 and earlier does not properly unset variables when the input data includes a numeric parameter with a value matching an alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the tb_id parameter. NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in WordPress.
254	CVE-2007-0109			+Info	2007-01-08	2018-10-16	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	None	None	wp-login.php in WordPress 2.0.5 and earlier displays different error messages if a user exists or not, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information and facilitates brute force attacks.
255	CVE-2007-0107			Exec Code Sql Bypass	2007-01-08	2018-10-16	6.8	User	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	WordPress before 2.0.6, when mbstring is enabled for PHP, decodes alternate character sets after escaping the SQL query, which allows remote attackers to bypass SQL injection protection schemes and execute arbitrary SQL commands via multibyte charsets, as demonstrated using UTF-7.
256	CVE-2007-0106			XSS CSRF	2007-01-08	2018-10-16	6.8	User	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CSRF protection scheme in WordPress before 2.0.6 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a CSRF attack with an invalid token and quote characters or HTML tags in URL variable names, which are not properly handled when WordPress generates a new link to verify the request.
